# toolkit-seascape agent guidance

## Scope and current state

Bathymetry, marine geomorphology, coastal geometry, and derived features.

This repository contains the installable `seascape` package extracted from OrcaCast on 2026-09-15.
Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for ownership/import changes; `docs/CONTRACTS.md` for scientific
or product changes; README.md and docs/MIGRATION.md for setup or extraction-history questions.
Preserve unrelated changes and read deeper instructions before editing a subdirectory.

## Shared MarineCast context

For boundary, dependency, shared schema/provenance, or application-integration changes, read
[INFRASTRUCTURE.md](https://github.com/MarineCast/.github/blob/HEAD/INFRASTRUCTURE.md).
In the grouped workspace use `../../.github/INFRASTRUCTURE.md`; in a flat clone layout use
`../.github/INFRASTRUCTURE.md`, resolving from this checkout. Otherwise use the linked copy;
if unavailable, report the limitation without inventing a shared standard. Sibling instructions
are not inherited. Local implementation contracts remain authoritative; surface conflicts.

## Domain contracts

Preserve horizontal CRS, vertical datum, depth/elevation sign conventions, units, raster alignment,
and nodata masks. Define the spatial scale and neighborhood used by derived terrain metrics.
Keep land/water classification and missing coverage explicit. Geomorphology describes physical
features; species habitat suitability belongs in a downstream application.

## Implementation boundaries

- Keep this toolkit species-neutral and independently installable; do not require an OrcaCast
  checkout or import through sibling filesystem paths.
- Before adding a pipeline, define source rights, input/output grain, units, spatial and temporal
  support, missingness, provenance, and validation in the repository documentation.
- Add dependency declarations and runnable setup/validation commands with the implementation;
  do not copy viewshed's GDAL stack or commands unless this toolkit actually needs them.
- Prefer deterministic calculations and small synthetic/offline fixtures. Keep credentials,
  downloads, and large generated products out of tracked source.
- Keep unknown and unavailable values distinct from observed zero. Validate uniqueness and join
  cardinality rather than silently dropping conflicting records.

## Validation and completion

Use isolated Python 3.11+: `python -m pip install -e '.[test]'`.
Start behavior validation with `python -m pytest -q tests/<relevant_test>.py`, then the required
suite below. Documentation-only edits need reference checks and `git diff --check`, not Python tests.
No local skills are needed yet; load only the task-specific documents routed above.


For documentation-only work, inspect `git status --short` and the diff, verify references, and run
`git diff --check` from this repository. Run `python -m pytest -q` from this checkout after installing `.[test]`.
Use `seascape build --dry-run` to inspect stage dependencies. Real acquisition and regional builds
are separate from offline tests; three materialized-product tests skip without regional data.
When adding executable behavior, add appropriate checks and document their exact commands here.
Report tests actually run, unverified source acquisition, and any unrun integration paths.

## Codebase navigation

Use the existing local `graphify-out/graph.json` for structural questions; skip graph work for
obvious targeted edits. Prefer the smallest useful retrieval:

1. Known symbol: `explain` first, then follow only relevant callers/callees/imports/dependencies.
2. Use direct relationships before deeper traversal; broad `query` is for unknown ownership.
3. If results are large or truncated, narrow the symbol or relationship before increasing budget.
   `--budget` is not a guaranteed cap. Avoid unnecessary depth-2 neighborhoods.
4. Read the identified source/tests. They outrank schemas/contracts, architecture docs, then the
   graph. Use targeted `rg` when graph coverage or freshness is insufficient.

```bash
graphify explain "DomainBuildStage"
graphify affected "DomainBuildStage" --relation calls --depth 1
graphify query "<topic>" --context call --budget 1500
```

`affected` follows reverse edges (callers); `explain` shows immediate connections. Use ast-grep
for syntax patterns and `rg` for literal/config/prose/filename searches. Read architecture for
ownership/import changes, not every typo. Optional shared setup/examples:
[code navigation](https://github.com/MarineCast/.github/blob/HEAD/docs/code-navigation.md)
(local grouped workspace: `../../.github/docs/code-navigation.md`). No sibling checkout is required.

Graphify is optional developer tooling (`graphifyy==0.9.62`, isolated Python 3.10+), not a runtime
dependency. Create a missing graph or refresh after structural edits, from this checkout only:

```bash
graphify extract . --code-only --no-cluster
```

Do not rebuild merely for a question. Check intentional deletions before using `--force` to bypass
shrink protection. `.gitignore` and `.graphifyignore` apply; AST-only extraction does not index
prose semantically. Graphs/caches are disposable local-only files: never commit or publish them.
Any future sharing requires an explicit policy covering destination, revision, freshness and review.
Global skill defaults do not override repository scope or code-only extraction. Do not run
`graphify codex install` over maintained instructions or enable hooks/merge drivers implicitly.
